# Changelog for PSImmich

The format is based on and uses the types of changes according to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Versioning of the PSImmich module will follow the Immich version. For instance v1.105.X will correspond to the API version of Immich 1.105.X. The third number (patch) will be used to track releases/fixes for the PSImmich module specifically. This makes it much easier to find the correct PSImmich version that has feature parity with the version of Immich that is used. If Immich releases a new version that does not require an update to the PSImmich module, that version number will simply be skipped. So the version of PSImmich might not be sequentially incremented.
